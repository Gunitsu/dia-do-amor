          Can you hear me say your name forever?<br>
          Can you see me longing for you forever?<br>
          Would you let me touch your soul forever?<br>
          Can you feel me longing for you forever, forever?
      </p>
      <p>
          I know the light grows darker down below<br>
          But in your eyes it's gone before you know<br>
          This is the moment of just letting go<br>
          She said, "If you had life eternal"
      </p>
      <p>
          Can you hear me say your name forever?<br>
          Can you see me longing for you forever, forever?<br>
          Would you let me touch your soul forever?<br>
          Can you feel me longing for you forever, forever?
